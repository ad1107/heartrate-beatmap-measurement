# Instructions

**Warning: Due to the hiatus nature of [`gosumemory`](https://github.com/l3lackShark/gosumemory), it is recommended to use [`tosu`](https://github.com/tosuapp/tosu) as it's both in active development and it's compatible with all gosumemory API. However, feel free to use gosumemory with this if you want.**

- Install [`tosu`](https://github.com/tosuapp/tosu).
- Run [`tosu.exe`]() (Don't need to run any included overlay)
- Supply your HypeRate API key on the `config.js` file.
- Launch `index.html?code=[YOUR CODE]` link and add as a Browser Source in OBS.

- **OR** You can also copy the source code into the `static` folder to launch as an overlay in `gosumemory` with this link [`http://127.0.0.1:24050/heartrate-beatmap-measurement/?code=[YOUR-CODE]`](http://127.0.0.1:24050/heartrate-beatmap-measurement/?code=[YOUR-CODE)
